# Requriments

## About the project WCS
### Description
*This Project is an __Wiper control (WCS) system__,a wiper control system for an automotive wiper controls the operational speed of a wiper in accordance with rain conditions.It useful in the automotive unit the main purpose of the system is to clean the windscreen sufficiently to provide suitable visibility at all times.

---

## Identifying features
*When the button is pressed once the car will start(__Ignition key postion at ACC__)

*When the button is pressed again the wiper will start(__Wiper On__)

*When the button is pressed again the wiper will off(__Wiper Off__)

*When the button is pressed thrice the car will stop(__Ignition key position at Lock__)

## State of art
*The main focus point is seeing the wiper control of the car.

*And also seeing the seep of the wiper system in the car

*Now this two features are explained in these project

---
## 5W's & 1H and S.W.O.T analysis is in the below table 

| 5W's & 1H | 

*What  -- wiper control system (WCS)

*Where --Inside and out side the car

*When  --When the weather condition is bad (like in rain and snow) the wiper is activate and clean the car window

*Who   --Who is driving or controlling the car

*How   --By using STM like by multiple pushes on a button

| S.W.O.T ANALYSIS |

Strengths

*No human interaction with car
*Manages all commands with one key automatically
*encryption in data

Weaknesses

*Unable to monitor status of car
*Range is limited
*Wait for certain time after every command to press new command 

Opportunities

*The Scope of this sytem is huge in car control
*can be used where  the car need thesed command
*Less cost

Threats

*When new command is given without completing the current command it will not take current command
